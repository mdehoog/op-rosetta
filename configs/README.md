## configs

A collection of configuration files used to test the `op-rosetta` client using [`rosetta-cli`](https://github.com/coinbase/rosetta-cli).

These config files were built using the [rosett-cli documentation](https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/rosetta_test.html).


### Setup

First, [install `rosetta-cli`](https://github.com/coinbase/rosetta-cli#install).

If the installation script doesn't work (on mac it may not), try cloning the repo and installing from source:

```bash
gh repo clone coinbase/rosetta-cli
cd rosetta-cli
make install
```


### Testing

_NOTE: `op-rosetta` must be running on the specified host and port provided in the configuration file. For local testing, this can be done as described in the root [README.md](../README.md#running) section, which will run an instance on localhost, port 8080._

To validate with `rosetta-cli`, run one of the following commands:

* `rosetta-cli check:data --configuration-file optimism/config.json` - This command validates that the Data API implementation is correct using the ethereum `optimism` node. It also ensures that the implementation does not miss any balance-changing operations.

* `rosetta-cli check:construction --configuration-file optimism/config.json` - This command validates the Construction API implementation. It also verifies transaction construction, signing, and submissions to the `optimism` network.

* `rosetta-cli check:data --configuration-file optimism/config.json` - This command validates that the Data API implementation is correct using the ethereum `optimism` node. It also ensures that the implementation does not miss any balance-changing operations.

> *Note*
>
> Running data validation takes a couple hours to completion. Once complete, the tool prints a report of any issues it encountered.
> If it fails to do so, there's likely an issue in the implementation of the `op-rosetta` client.


### Bedrock Compatibility

The rosetta configuration file must have its start_index set to the Bedrock fork block. If it’s set to any prior block then validation fails as op-rosetta fails to parse OVM (pre-Bedrock) transactions. Here’s a sample rosetta configuration file:

```
{
  "network": {
    "blockchain": "Optimism",
    "network": "goerli"
  },
  "online_url": "http://localhost:5000",
  "data_directory": "/tmp/rosetta-cli-goerli-bedrock-db",
  "http_timeout": 300,
  "max_retries": 30,
  "max_online_connections": 30,
  "max_sync_concurrency": 30,
  "tip_delay": 120,
  "compression_disabled": true,
  "construction": null,
  "data": {
    "historical_balance_disabled": false,
    "active_reconciliation_concurrency": 30,
    "start_index": 4307133,
    "log_balance_changes": true,
    "log_transactions": true,
    "log_blocks": true,
    "end_conditions": {
        "tip": true
    }
  }
}
```


### Reference

The `rosetta-cli` offers a number of commands useful for checking the implementation of the `op-rosetta` client. For more information, run `rosetta-cli --help` for the following output:

```

  view:block                   View a block
  view:networks                View all network statuses

Flags:
      --block-profile string        Save the pprof block profile in the specified file
      --configuration-file string   Configuration file that provides connection and test settings.
                                    If you would like to generate a starter configuration file (populated
                                    with the defaults), run rosetta-cli configuration:create.

                                    Any fields not populated in the configuration file will be populated with
                                    default values.
      --cpu-profile string          Save the pprof cpu profile in the specified file
  -h, --help                        help for rosetta-cli
      --mem-profile string          Save the pprof mem profile in the specified file

Use "rosetta-cli [command] --help" for more information about a command.
